# Resource Gen
This tool was developed for Minecraft modding but can be used for other purposes, quicking copies and generates files based on input arguments

The code itself is probably bad, I'm not a python developer, but it works.

### Example Use:
Put the files you want copied into a folder named **resources** All file names must contain **[replace]** or the file will not be copied. All instances of the string **[replace]**  inside Text files (or files readable by text) will be replaced. 

Example input and output has been provided with the repo
